* PlutoTable

Ag-grid based table viewer for Pluto. Contributions welcome.

** Usage:
#+begin_src julia
     ##
     using PlutoTable

     ## Make DataFrames display using PlutoTable by default
     PlutoTable.register(DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame)

     ## Alternatively (can be used independently/in parallel with previous mode)
     showtable(table; ## Any Tables.jl compatible table
                        page_size=1000, ## Pagination threshold/size. Can be set to 0 to disable
                        size_threshold=1000_000, ## Max rows for full "clientside" mode.
                        height="40vh", ## Any CSS acceptible height, although some are funky.
                        formatters=(), ## ~pairs~-able object with ~name:>String=>eltype(table[name])->string~ pairs, where the return value of the callable is what is shown in the table.
                        default_formatter=default_formatter, ## Default formatter function of the signature above, replacing missing values with empty strings and values that can't be sent directly to js by their julia string representation.
                        server_sort_threshold=10_000_000, ## Size threshold beyond which server sorting by columns is disabled (to avoid accidentally freezing pluto for a long op).
                        render_html=false ## Render html in formatted strings (otherwise shown verbatim). Has a performance cost so is disabled by default.
               )
#+end_src
** todo
- Server side filtering. Was deemed less critical for as filtering can be done interactively in pluto itself.
- Remove dependency on CDN
